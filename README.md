# Challenges (perhaps I call this problem solution)

challenge zero: how do I make links in this mark-down file. 

challenge 50: What's the best practice for designating width of my containers? a hard-coded width or a screen size percentage? or a minimum of both? 

challenge 100: Font family does not seem to be working well. I still see Sans. 

    ~fonts such as google fonts can be imported through the html in a link tag or on top of the style.css file. The css way seems more direct.
    ~Take care for how your ff variable is named. 

challenge 200: How do I name sections and containers?

challenge 250: how do I decided what to make a container? 

challenge 300: font look is hard to get right, especially following the style guide. 

    ~I created variables from the style guide, but so far I've manually corrected many things to get the desired look.
